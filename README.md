# Algorithme best combination of actions

## Description

 There are two scripts. bruteforce.py and optimized.py.
 Both are to help customer to buy the most rentable actions.  

## Setup

Create a virtualenv for the project with Python 3.10.4  
    
```
python -m venv env 
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```  

## Run the script  

Run this command for bruteforce:  

```
python3 bruteforce.py
```    
Run this command for optimized:  

```
python3 optimized.py
``` 

## What I learned with this project is

I learned what a search algorithm is. Its importance.
That there are several of them to do exactly the same thing.
And how to determine their complexity and thus choose the one that will be most suitable for a given situation.
